  abstract = {Since the turn of the twenty-first century, Canadian unions have scored a number of important Supreme Court victories, securing constitutional rights to picket, bargain collectively, and strike. Unions in Court documents the evolution of the Canadian labour movement's engagement with the Charter, demonstrating how and why labour's long-standing distrust of the legal system has given way to a controversial, Charter-based legal strategy. This book's in-depth examination of constitutional labour rights will have critical implications for labour movements as well as activists in other fields.},
