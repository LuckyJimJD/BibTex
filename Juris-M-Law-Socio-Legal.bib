  abstract = {This book seeks to provide answers to everything you ever wanted to know about the law—except what the rules are or ought to be. For centuries, the law has been considered a neutral, objective arena that sets societal standards and in which conflicting forces resolve disputes. More recently, however, the interaction between law and society has been recognized as a two-way street: society clearly exacts a considerable influence on the practice and evolution of law. Further, the discrepancy between what the law mandates and what the social reality is has served as evidence of the chasm between theory and practice, between the abstraction of law and its actual societal effects. Examining such issues as the limits of legal change and the capacity of law to act as a revolutionary agent, the essays in this book offer a well-rounded introduction to the relationship between law and society. By focusing on flashpoint issues in legal studies—equality, consciousness and ideology, social control--and making ample use of engaging case studies, The Law and Society Review provides an invaluable resource for scholars and students alike.},

In doing so, these supporters have echoed a long-standing scholarly argument that rights-based litigation strategies are ineffective at best and counterproductive at worst. In the gay rights context, one version of this argument has been particularly prominent: even when rights advocates win in court, those},

Decades of research shows how much the nature of communities, organizations, and the people inhabiting them affect how law works. Just as much, law shapes beliefs, behaviors, and wider social structures, but the connections are much more nuancedOCoand surprisingOCothan many expect. Law and Society Reader II provides readers an accessible overview to the breadth of recent developments in this research tradition, bringing to life the developments in this dynamic field. Following up a first Law and Society Reader published in 1995, editors Erik W. Larson and Patrick D. Schmidt have compiled excerpts of 43 illuminating articles published since 1993 in The Law \& Society Review, the flagship journal of the Law and Society Association. By its organization and approach, this volume enables readers to join in discussing the key ideas of law and society research. The selections highlight the core insights and developments in this research tradition, making these works indispensable for those exploring the field and ideal for classroom use. Across six concisely-introduced sections, this volume analyzes inequality, lawyering, the relation between law and organizations, and the place of law in relation to other social institutions."},

Over the course of the next century, until the 1967 Supreme Court decision \emph{Loving v. Virginia} declared anti-miscegenation laws unconstitutional, an additional 14 states came to ban marriages between whites and Asians. While social scientists have detailed extensively how whites created laws to limit the rights and privileges of minority groups within the United States, less frequently examined are the manner by which these laws helped shape and determine the meaning of racial groups and the features selected to demarcate group boundaries.},

The Centennial Accord constituted a striking reversal of Washington State practices and generated national and international attention. Infamously, the state government and its citizenry had for years emphatically denied tribal sovereignty through their words and actions. Continuing with the previous practice of treating tribes and tribal members as ethnic groups subordinate to state authority, the state and},

Social psychologists, sociologists, and other law and society scholars have a long-standing interest in understanding why people want to punish rule breakers, that is, in understanding the social meaning of rule-breaking behavior.  This study explores why people want to punish rule breakers. It addresses two issues: (1) the sources of support for the punishment of rule-breaking behavior and (2) the nature of public support for punishing those who break social rules. Three basic sources of support are compared: crime-related concerns, concerns},

Kramer and Tushnet have offered two of the most prominent arguments for restricting the court’s role in determining the meaning of the Constitution. Kramer emphasizes popular conclusions about the Constitution, while Tushnet stresses congressional deliberation. Yet these authors share the central conviction that courts’ active involvement in constitutional politics discourages and distorts the participation of nonjudicial actors (Tushnet 1999; Kramer 2004). The main thrust of both arguments is that American politics would be more democratic, and therefore better, if},
