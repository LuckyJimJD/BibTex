  abstract = {The resurgence of antisemitism -- from the deadly Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, the alt-right's chant of "Jews will not replace us," up to recent controversies within the Women's March and UK Labour Party -- caught many observers off guard. Although antisemitism is on the rise in the U.S., it has -- until recently -- remained conspicuously absent from progressive/left discourse and activism. These recent incidents have restored the term to the lexicon of the left, however there remains a tendency to focus exclusively on the more deadly antisemitism of the right while remaining silent about less deadly manifestations on the left. This article seeks to fill this political and analytical void by highlighting this "invisible" form of racism, challenging some common assumptions found on the left, and offering analytical and political tools rooted in an emancipatory perspective. We show that the left has a long and complicated historical relationship with antisemitism. By focusing on how antisemitism can manifest in left critiques of capitalism or global politics, we illustrate how it both overlaps with and diverges from the antisemitism of the right. We use recent examples to describe common rhetorical strategies employed to deny or downplay the existence of antisemitism within left movements, or derail conversations about it from taking place. As antisemitism continues to shape the contemporary political landscape, we argue that emancipatory movements must become familiar with its specific contours and actively address it in their political work.},

  abstract = {The paper argues that the critique of modern antisemitism is fundamentally a critique of capitalist political economy. It expounds the critical tradition associated with the work of Marx, Horkheimer, Adorno and Postone, to argue that antisemitism is innate to the existent society. It explores antisemitism as a perverted form of anti-capitalism, one which associates labour economy with freedom, Arbeit macht frei, and rejects the manifestation of labour economy in the form of money as more money. It specifies antisemitism as a personalised critique of a crisis-ridden dynamic of real economic abstractions, of price and profit, and their regulation by the invisible hand. Modern antisemitism identifies the ghostlike character of the economic object, what Marx called the capital fetish, with the character and the power of the Jew.},

  abstract = {This article argues that "Cultural Marxism" is an antisemitic conspiracy theory, by drawing from three of the main proponents of the theory in the United States today. According to the conspiracy theory, the Jewish Marxists of the Frankfurt School implemented a slow takeover of "culture," seeking to undermine Christianity, family, and nation in favor of a new worldview and system of control, involving mass immigration, sexual liberation, and moral and aesthetic decline. Cultural Marxists, the conspiracy theorists believe, now control all areas of public life, including the media, schools, entertainment, the economy, and national and global systems of governance. Not only does this theory vastly overestimate the influence of a small group of intellectuals, the conspiracy theory trades on the Frankfurt School's perceived Jewishness and amplifies antisemitic tropes. This article focuses on three of the main proponents of the Cultural Marxism conspiracy theory--white nationalist Kevin MacDonald and self-titled paleo-conservatives William S. Lind and Paul Gottfried--showing how the work of each on the Frankfurt School amplifies antisemitic tropes and engages in conspiracy thinking that misrepresents the Frankfurt School's ideas and influence.},

  abstract = {Conducted through archival research of primary documents including period newspaper articles, meeting notes, and political pamphlets at the Oregon Historical Society, this article investigates the development of inter-war fascism in Oregon as a key inflection point in the germination of the modern white power movement. Contrasting the novel organization and dissemination of inter-war fascism in Oregon with the earlier rise of the Ku Klux Klan, this research illustrates the influences of European ideological currents on the domestic far right as it attempted to consolidate dispersed networks of ethnic interest groups and political leaders into a radical force for change. We track the successes and failures of the fascist movement as its followers integrated within the ranks of law enforcement and public officials, and the impact of the Second World War on their ensuing, conflictive relationship with the federal government. Our findings indicate that the inter-war fascist movement in Oregon saw the broadening of U.S. "Americanism" to include Catholics and immigrants while simultaneously seeing its numbers dwindle. This emergence of a more inclusive sense of whiteness, combined with resentment against the federal government following the Second World War, produced new conceptualizations of "white nationalism" and "white power" as revolutionary slogans far removed from the politically-powerful, populist mass movement that the Klan created in the 1920s. However, we argue that political marginalization of rural areas by the left only reifies the popularization of the far-right Patriot movement as an "outsider force," normalizing fascist ideology in the process.},

The main contention is that the dialectic of capitalism and emancipation is central to understanding antisemitism: the fact that capitalism itself creates the conditions of, and the means for, overcoming capitalism produces the space of confusion in which the concept of 'left-wing antisemitism' emerges.},

  abstract = {The question of antisemitism inside of the Left--referred to as "left antisemitism"--is a stubborn and persistent problem. And while the Right exaggerates both its depth and scope, the Left has repeatedly refused to face the issue. It is entangled in scandals about antisemitism at an increasing rate. On the Western Left, some antisemitism manifests in the form of conspiracy theories, but there is also a hegemonic refusal to acknowledge antisemitism's existence and presence. This, in turn, is part of a larger refusal to deal with Jewish issues in general, or to engage with the Jewish community as a real entity. Debates around left antisemitism have risen in tandem with the spread of anti-Zionism inside of the Left, especially since the Second Intifada. Anti-Zionism is not, by itself, antisemitism. One can call for the Right of Return, as well as dissolving Israel as a Jewish state, without being antisemitic. But there is a Venn diagram between anti- Zionism and antisemitism, and the overlap is both significant and has many shades of grey to it. One of the main reasons the Left can't acknowledge problems with antisemitism is that Jews persistently trouble categories, and the Left would have to rethink many things--including how it approaches antiimperialism, nationalism of the oppressed, anti-Zionism, identity politics, populism, conspiracy theories, and critiques of finance capital--if it was to truly struggle with the question. The Left understands that white supremacy isn't just the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazis, but that it is part of the fabric of society, and there is no shortcut to unstitching it. Antisemitism is also woven into social relationships--having been part of Western society since at least the Middle Ages. But the Left doesn't understand that. The problem is not just limited to the open and coded conspiracy theories about Jews and Jewish collectivities that circulate on the Left. It also can be seen in how the complex conflict in Israel/Palestine is compressed into a blackand- white portrayal, complete with the demonization of one party-- and mixed with out-of-hand dismissals of the Jewish community's complaints about antisemitism. Any acceptable approach must start with suppressing antisemitic conspiracy theories and refusing to uncritically back antisemitic groups--something that currently isn't happening. If the Left can't even get to first base, it is undoubtedly part of the rising tide of antisemitism we are seeing today. But dealing with this would mean far more than just taking these obvious actions, and the only way to work these issues out is to wrangle with them directly. The Left would do well to live up to its own values of opposing oppression by taking antisemitism in its own ranks seriously.},

[...]it may do the opposite; it may encourage hatred and violence as evidenced by the fact that some of the perpetrators of anti-Jewish attacks today have been known to have Googled questions like, for example, "Why Did Hitler Hate Jews?"10 The current popular writing about American Jews in the era of the pandemic (and Trump) feels eerily like Leidensgeschichte (the history of suffering), but without the Gelehrtengeschichte (the history of learning) that was equally a hallmark of much nineteenth-century Jewish historiography. In his piece, Roth challenged the idea that all violence from which Jews suffered was automatically antisemitic.17 Episodes of "Jewish martyrdom," Roth argued, were very often episodes of "general history," with Jews caught in bigger events.18 A few years later, Roth published his popular A Short History of the Jewish People, in which he declared his desire "to break with" earlier Jewish historiography that tended to overstress "the traditional tale of woe. [...]both authors explicitly or implicitly used their scholarship to combat antisemitism, in part by expanding the existing understanding of what Jewish life and experience had been like in the past.21 Both Baron and Roth, in different ways, strove},
