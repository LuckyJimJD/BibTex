We examine the relationship between nonstandard employment (on-call work and day labor, temporary-help agency employment, employment with contract companies, independent contracting, other self-employment, and part-time employment in "conventional" jobs) and exposure to "bad" job characteristics, using data from the 1995 Current Population Survey. Of workers age 18 and over, 31 percent are in some type of nonstandard employment. To assess the link between type of employment and bad jobs, we conceptualize "bad jobs" as those with low pay and without access to health insurance and pension benefits. About one in seven jobs in the United States is bad on these three dimensions. Nonstandard employment strongly increases workers' exposure to bad job characteristics, net of controls for workers' personal characteristics, family status, occupation, and industry.},

  abstract = {Every year in Canada and the U.S., the share of higher education faculty who teach off the tenure track grows. One might expect that faculty unionization would limit this process, but the data examined here indicate that this is not so. While Canadian universities are significantly more unionized than their U.S. counterparts, they rely at least as heavily on contingent faculty. Similarly, U.S. states with high levels of unionization do not exhibit lower levels of casualization. Union strategies that institutionalize divisions between tenure-track and non-tenure-track, and/or between part-time and full-time faculty, probably play a role in this outcome. They can and should also play a pivotal role in reversing these trends if they develop the political will to do so.},

  abstract = {It has been over two decades since the United States Supreme Court handed down the landmark Yeshiva decision. In that case, the faculty in a private university was determined to be "managerial" and not entitled to collective bargaining rights and other protections under federal labor law. Despite Yeshiva's broad and significant impact in deterring faculty organizing at private colleges and universities, successful union organizing drives, though few, have been growing more frequent on campuses across the United States. In this paper, we examine the Yeshiva case and analyze its implications for private and public universities, including current trends such as the increased use of contingent faculty and distance learning. We also examine successful organizing efforts and discuss their implications for organized labor.},

To handle the endogeneity of faculty unionization, an index of state employee collective bargaining rights is used as an instrument for unionization. Findings indicate that unionization greatly increases faculty influence over institutional decision-making, both in compensation and in areas outside of compensation.},

Likewise, perceptions of union efficacy, a liberal identity as well the professor’s education level predicted the actual joining of their campus’ faculty union.},

  abstract = {Feminist philosophers have challenged a wide range of gender injustices in professional philosophy. However, the problem of precarity, that is, the increasing numbers of contingent faculty who cannot find permanent employment, has received scarcely any attention. What explains this oversight? In this article, I argue, first, that academics are held in the grips of an ideology that diverts attention away from the structural conditions of precarity, and second, that the gendered dimensions of such an ideology have been overlooked. To do so, I identify two myths: the myth of meritocracy and the myth of work as its own reward. I demonstrate that these myths—and the two-tier system itself—manifest an unmistakably gendered logic, such that gender and precarity are mutually reinforcing and co-constitutive. I conclude that feminist philosophers have particular reason to organize against the casualization of academic work.},

  abstract = {Organizing of adjunct faculty is intensifying, and now is a good time to talk about strategies. This article argues that while the “hot shop” strategy, with its emphasis on getting authorization cards signed and moving swiftly toward an election, is racking up wins, it risks failing to develop the respectful interpersonal relationships that can carry a union through the hard times of bargaining and enforcing a contract. Two other strategies can make a difference. They depend on providing an answer to the question “Who is we?”, which is a counter to the fragmentation of the faculty workforce created by budgets, labor law, administrative fiat, and management tools intended to undermine solidarity. One is the Metro Strategy, which treats a whole regional faculty workforce as a single “we,” recognizing the realities of commute times, parking problems, and conflicting schedules. It recommends setting up a centrally located workers' center that provides both material resources like WiFi, meeting rooms, and toilets, and organizing resources like information. It acknowledges a regional, not institution-bound, workforce. The second strategy addresses the disciplinary achievements of adjunct faculty, who are often invisible within our own institutions. This strategy is drawn from theories of communities of practice generated by the anthropologist, Jean Lave, who investigated how communities as diverse as tailors and midwives passed on the wisdom and skills of their practices from one generation to another. Organizing using this approach as a guide means focusing on what the adjuncts who share a discipline or practice actually do in their professional, academic lives. This allows space for a “we” based on our real work, not on what an institution defines us to be.},

Subsequently, we focus on academic labor markets in terms of “academic capitalism” and the restructuring of academic institutions, “managed professionals” and the restructuring of academic labor, and the efforts of “organizing professionals” to negotiate a new academy. Analytically, we focus on rising secondary labor markets. We also attend to their social demography, noting international and local dimensions that take us beyond and below the national labor markets that are the literature’s overriding focus.

  abstract = {In the tradition of Barbara Ehrenreich’s classic Nickel and Dimed, a talented young journalist goes undercover as a casino labor-union organizer in this rare inside look at the ongoing struggle of hourly-wage service workers to survive in America.“Salting” is a simple concept—get hired at a non-union company, do the job you were hired to do, and, with the help of organizers on the outside, unionize your coworkers from the inside. James Walsh spent two years as a “salt” in two casinos in South Florida, working as a buffet server and a bartender. Neither his employers nor the union knew of Walsh’s intentions to write about his experience. Now he reveals hard-won and little-known truths about how unions fight to organize service workers, the vigorous corporate opposition against them, and how workers get caught in the middle. As a salt, Walsh witnessed the cultish nature of labor organization and was constantly grilled by his union organizer as to whether he had enough grit and determination to win converts to the cause while remaining undercover. At work, Walsh witnessed the oddities of casino life and management’s stunning mistreatment of service industry employees, most of whom were hanging on to economic survival by their fingernails. His meticulous reporting reveals supervisors berating workers for the smallest infractions, even as employees submit to relentless scrutiny, ever-changing work schedules, and the callous behavior of casino customers. A clear-eyed and balanced account, Playing Against the House explores the trials of day-to-day life for the working poor and the face of twenty-first-century union organizing and union busting in unprecedented detail.},

  abstract = {Open access to research and scholarship, although well established in the sciences, remains an emerging phenomenon in the legal academy. In recent years, a number of open access repositories have been created to permit self-archiving of legal scholarship (either within or across institutional boundaries), and faculties at some leading research institutions have adopted policies supporting open access to their work. Although existing repositories for legal scholarship represent a clear improvement over proprietary, subscription-based repositories in some ways, their architecture, and the narrowly defined missions they have elected to pursue, limit their ability to illuminate the ongoing dialogue among texts that is a defining characteristic of scholarly discourse in law and the humanities. One of the wiki-based projects operated by the nonprofit Wikimedia Foundation - the Wikisource digital library - improves upon the shortcomings of existing open access repositories by bringing source texts and commentary together in a single place, with additional contextual materials hosted on other Wikimedia Foundation sites just a click away. These features of Wikisource, if more widely adopted, may improve academic discourse by highlighting conceptual interconnections among works, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, and reducing the competitive advantages of proprietary, closed-access legal information services.},

Code must be available to be distributed, data must be accessible in a readable format, and a platform must be available for widely distributing the data and code. In addition, both data and code need to be licensed permissively enough so that others can reproduce the work without a substantial legal burden. Implementing Reproducible Research covers many of the elements necessary for conducting and distributing reproducible research. It explains how to accurately reproduce a scientific result.   Divided into three parts, the book discusses the tools, practices, and dissemination platforms for ensuring reproducibility in computational science. It describes:   Computational tools, such as Sweave, knitr, VisTrails, Sumatra, CDE, and the Declaratron system Open source practices, good programming practices, trends in open science, and the role of cloud computing in reproducible research Software and methodological platforms, including open source software packages, RunMyCode platform, and open access journals  Each part presents contributions from leaders who have developed software and other products that have advanced the field.

Though computational reproducibility seems more straight forward than replicating physical experiments, the complex and rapidly changing nature of computer environments makes being able to reproduce and extend such work a serious challenge. In this paper, I explore common reasons that code developed for one research project cannot be successfully executed or extended by subsequent researchers. I review current approaches to these issues, including virtual machines and workflow systems, and their limitations. I then examine how the popular emerging technology Docker combines several areas from systems research - such as operating system virtualization, cross-platform portability, modular re-usable elements, versioning, and a 'DevOps' philosophy, to address these challenges. I illustrate this with several examples of Docker use with a focus on the R statistical environment.},

Tailored for academic and research requirements, Baadal bridges the gap between a private cloud and the requirements of an institution where request patterns and infrastructure are quite different from commercial settings. For example, researchers typically run simulations requiring hundreds of Virtual Machines (VMs) all communicating through message-passing interfaces to solve complex problems. We describe our experience with designing and developing a cloud workflow to support such requirements. Our workflow is quite different from that provided by other commercial cloud vendors (which we found not suited to our requirements).Another salient difference in academic computing infrastructure from commercial infrastructure is the physical resource availability. Often, a university has a small number of compute servers connected to shared SAN or NAS based storage. This may often not be enough to service the computation requirements of the whole university. Apart from this infrastructure, universities typically have a few hundred to a few thousand “workstations” which are commodity desktops with local disk-attached-storage. Most of these workstations remain grossly underutilized. Our cloud infrastructure utilizes this idle compute capacity to provide higher scalability for our cloud implementation.},

Data were from artisanal and recreational surveys carried out between 2006 and 2010. Competition between recreational (particularly spear fishing) and artisanal fishers for the natural resources is important as 52\% of the 98 species surveyed were caught by both types of fishers. A total of 87 species were caught by all artisanal fishing gears together (of which 84\% were retained and 16\% discarded). Recreational fishing caught 58 species of which none was systematically discarded. The two fishing techniques that raise major environmental concerns are spear fishing (very selective in terms of species and/or sizes and high intrinsic vulnerability of catches) and trammel netting (highest number of species discarded and highest number of species endangered). Important challenges from the social standpoint were found that need to be taken into account in the management of coastal fisheries in the Mediterranean Sea including: progressive disappearance of the artisanal fisheries, ageing of the artisanal fisher populations and decline in the number of fishing gears used by artisanal fishers.},

  abstract = {Understanding the relationship between fish populations, fishing success, and angler satisfaction is critical for effective fisheries management. Our objectives were to quantify angler satisfaction in a fishery for Rainbow Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss in central Oregon and examine the factors influencing angler satisfaction. Multinomial logistic regression models were used to determine the effect of several variables, including fishing success, on angler satisfaction. Measures of fishing success were present in all of the top candidate models. The probability of an increase in angler satisfaction rating was positively related to mean length and number of fish caught per hour. However, younger anglers tended to have higher satisfaction ratings at lower mean length and catch rates of fish than did older anglers. These models provided information on the expected percentage of anglers that will be satisfied given the average length of fish caught and the number of fish caught per hour. These results can be used to establish quantitative, measurable, management objectives that will satisfy desired percentages of anglers and lead to more effective fisheries management.

If legal pluralism is a common phenomenon, how is it to be discerned and understood? Secondly, there is the matter of institutional design: given the pervasiveness of legal pluralism, which management institutions are better suited to represent and resolve inter-legal system differences? The authors argue the case of co-management. Drawing on examples and insights from a comparative research project in South Asia, four basic types of legal pluralism and co-management are distinguished. The authors conclude that co-management is a process that brings legal systems, and their constituent organizations and groups, together within a single framework. For fisher organizations, which frequently have distinct legal perspectives, co-management is an essential path to legitimacy. For the state, other legal systems are a resource that management can draw upon.},

In this setting, discrete family-defined but individually "owned" lobster fishing berths coexist cheek by jowl with a "common ground" fishery. The principles governing the berth system derive, in part, from a land-based system of usufruct rights termed "kindnesses" in 18th century Scotland. The historical, familial, and community attributes of the berth system are outlined, as are the characteristics of the coexistent common ground fishery. Lobster harvesters with berth rights and many without argue that the berth system, in and of itself, is an effective conservation mechanism. This contention is described and discussed in relation to historical evidence respecting local lobster landings and recruitment characteristics. The paper concludes by arguing, first of all, that regulatory authorities should pay far more attention to the role played by informal property rights systems in accomplishing the goals of conservation and good management. While fisheries of this type are typically described in the literature as common property systems, we argue that they are, in fact, mixed property systems—a fact not adequately accounted for by existing regulatory policy or common property theory.},

  abstract = {This study explores the management of inland fisheries on common lands (ejidos) within the Mayan Zone of Quintana Roo, Mexico. Qualitative survey data are used to examine whether there are (a) ongoing fishery conservation activities; (b) local caretakers of fishing sites; (c) restrictions on where fishing can take place; and (d) particular groups of individuals who lack the right to fish within the ejidos. Results indicate that in contrast to other local resources, fisheries in the ejidos have less defined use rights, being viewed as largely "open access". In particular, most feel that outsiders can fish in an ejido if they abide by local rules (notably not damaging the local water bodies, asking consent to fish, and having a friend or relative in the community). However, there are within-community differences in views concerning management and conservation, with those more dependent on fishing being more likely to support exclusion of outsiders.},

  shorttitle = {Factions, {{Models}} and {{Resource Regulation}}},
  abstract = {One of the most important questions facing resource management is how to regulate industries exploiting natural resources. Currently there is an effort in the Maine lobster industry to get lower trap limits, which provides an opportunity to get detailed information on the political factors influencing legislation in an important and highly successful industry. In many industries, including the Maine lobster industry, many laws come in the aftermath of conflict between industry factions seeking laws to get distributional benefits. In the Maine lobster industry, the politics of getting lower trap limits are byzantine. Two factions have different models of the fishery, leading them to advocate different policies. The positions of people in each faction are very complicated. Those favoring a lower trap limit assume the industry is highly inefficient and that a lower trap limit would result in better catches per trap haul, lower costs of operations and higher profits. Some of those opposing a trap limit assume fishing more traps will lower profits; others assume it will raise profits. Those opposing lower trap limits offer five different sets of reasons for their viewpoint. To date, efforts to impose a lower trap limit have been blocked, but a number of factors could change the strength of the factions and tip the balance. In this industry, resource management policy is being made in an atmosphere in which different industry groups are pulling in different directions for complex sets of reasons.},
