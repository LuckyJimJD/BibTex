    Bad Jobs in America: Standard and Nonstandard Employment Relations and Job
    Quality in the United States
  container-title: American Sociological Review
  page: 256-278
  volume: '65'
  issue: '2'
  source: JSTOR
  abstract: >-
    The prevalence of nonstandard jobs is a matter of concern if, as many
    assume, such jobs are bad. We examine the relationship between nonstandard
    employment (on-call work and day labor, temporary-help agency employment,
    employment with contract companies, independent contracting, other
    self-employment, and part-time employment in "conventional" jobs) and
    exposure to "bad" job characteristics, using data from the 1995 Current
    Population Survey. Of workers age 18 and over, 31 percent are in some type
    of nonstandard employment. To assess the link between type of employment and
    bad jobs, we conceptualize "bad jobs" as those with low pay and without
    access to health insurance and pension benefits. About one in seven jobs in
    the United States is bad on these three dimensions. Nonstandard employment
    strongly increases workers' exposure to bad job characteristics, net of
    controls for workers' personal characteristics, family status, occupation,
    and industry.

    Reorganizing Higher Education in the United States and Canada: The Erosion
    of Tenure and the Unionization of Contingent Faculty
  container-title: Labor Studies Journal
  page: 117-140
  volume: '33'
  issue: '2'
  source: SAGE Journals
  abstract: >-
    Every year in Canada and the U.S., the share of higher education faculty who
    teach off the tenure track grows. One might expect that faculty unionization
    would limit this process, but the data examined here indicate that this is
    not so. While Canadian universities are significantly more unionized than
    their U.S. counterparts, they rely at least as heavily on contingent
    faculty. Similarly, U.S. states with high levels of unionization do not
    exhibit lower levels of casualization. Union strategies that
    institutionalize divisions between tenure-track and non-tenure-track, and/or
    between part-time and full-time faculty, probably play a role in this
    outcome. They can and should also play a pivotal role in reversing these
    trends if they develop the political will to do so.

  source: SAGE Journals
  abstract: >-
    It has been over two decades since the United States Supreme Court handed
    down the landmark Yeshiva decision. In that case, the faculty in a private
    university was determined to be "managerial" and not entitled to collective
    bargaining rights and other protections under federal labor law. Despite
    Yeshiva's broad and significant impact in deterring faculty organizing at
    private colleges and universities, successful union organizing drives,
    though few, have been growing more frequent on campuses across the United
    States. In this paper, we examine the Yeshiva case and analyze its
    implications for private and public universities, including current trends
    such as the increased use of contingent faculty and distance learning. We
    also examine successful organizing efforts and discuss their implications
    for organized labor.

  volume: '66'
  issue: '5'
  source: SAGE Journals
  abstract: >-
    The author's goal in this article is to estimate the causal effect of
    unionization on institutional decision-making, using a national survey of
    presidents and faculty senate leaders to measure the level of shared
    governance at 341 public universities in 15 different areas. To handle the
    endogeneity of faculty unionization, an index of state employee collective
    bargaining rights is used as an instrument for unionization. Findings
    indicate that unionization greatly increases faculty influence over
    institutional decision-making, both in compensation and in areas outside of
    compensation.

  abstract: >-
    This study traces the development of union loyalties among community college
    professors. Assuming that activism is motivated by contextual and
    ideological factors, the paper analyzes the ways that social networks,
    collegiate workplaces, and framing practices transform political bystanders
    into committed union members. Using data from a study of junior college
    professors in Kentucky (N = 329), the study finds that union participation
    is strongly linked to a distrust of campus administrators and having
    pro-union friends and colleagues. Likewise, perceptions of union efficacy, a
    liberal identity as well the professor’s education level predicted the
    actual joining of their campus’ faculty union.

  container-title: Hypatia

  volume: '33'
  issue: '2'
  source: Wiley Online Library
  abstract: >-
    Feminist philosophers have challenged a wide range of gender injustices in
    professional philosophy. However, the problem of precarity, that is, the
    increasing numbers of contingent faculty who cannot find permanent
    employment, has received scarcely any attention. What explains this
    oversight? In this article, I argue, first, that academics are held in the
    grips of an ideology that diverts attention away from the structural
    conditions of precarity, and second, that the gendered dimensions of such an
    ideology have been overlooked. To do so, I identify two myths: the myth of
    meritocracy and the myth of work as its own reward. I demonstrate that these
    myths—and the two-tier system itself—manifest an unmistakably gendered
    logic, such that gender and precarity are mutually reinforcing and
    co-constitutive. I conclude that feminist philosophers have particular
    reason to organize against the casualization of academic work.

    This article begins with a brief history of unionization and collective
    bargaining in higher education.  It then presents data concerning the recent
    growth in newly certified collective bargaining representatives at private
    and public-sector institutions of higher education, particularly among
    non-tenure track faculty.  The data is analyzed in the context of legal
    decisions concerning employee status and unit composition under applicable
    federal and state laws.  Lastly, the article presents data concerning strike
    activities on campuses between January 2013 and May 31, 2017.

    Organizing as Learning: The Metro Strategy and a Community of Practice for
    Faculty
  container-title: WorkingUSA
  page: 421-433
  volume: '18'
  issue: '3'
  source: Wiley Online Library
  abstract: >-
    Organizing of adjunct faculty is intensifying, and now is a good time to
    talk about strategies. This article argues that while the “hot shop”
    strategy, with its emphasis on getting authorization cards signed and moving
    swiftly toward an election, is racking up wins, it risks failing to develop
    the respectful interpersonal relationships that can carry a union through
    the hard times of bargaining and enforcing a contract. Two other strategies
    can make a difference. They depend on providing an answer to the question
    “Who is we?”, which is a counter to the fragmentation of the faculty
    workforce created by budgets, labor law, administrative fiat, and management
    tools intended to undermine solidarity. One is the Metro Strategy, which
    treats a whole regional faculty workforce as a single “we,” recognizing the
    realities of commute times, parking problems, and conflicting schedules. It
    recommends setting up a centrally located workers' center that provides both
    material resources like WiFi, meeting rooms, and toilets, and organizing
    resources like information. It acknowledges a regional, not
    institution-bound, workforce. The second strategy addresses the disciplinary
    achievements of adjunct faculty, who are often invisible within our own
    institutions. This strategy is drawn from theories of communities of
    practice generated by the anthropologist, Jean Lave, who investigated how
    communities as diverse as tailors and midwives passed on the wisdom and
    skills of their practices from one generation to another. Organizing using
    this approach as a guide means focusing on what the adjuncts who share a
    discipline or practice actually do in their professional, academic lives.
    This allows space for a “we” based on our real work, not on what an
    institution defines us to be.

    Academic Capitalism and (Secondary) Academic Labor Markets: Negotiating a
    New Academy and Research Agenda
  container-title: 'Higher Education: Handbook of Theory and Research'
  collection-title: 'Higher Education: Handbook of Theory and Research'
  publisher: 'Springer, Cham'

  abstract: >-
    The chapter examines how academic labor markets in the U.S. are socially
    structured. These markets express and enhance social stratification, and are
    reproduced and renegotiated through ongoing social action. First, we review
    the classic literature on the subject. Then we consider the presence of
    secondary labor markets in STEM fields, contextualizing our consideration of
    academic labor markets in developments in the larger labor force.
    Subsequently, we focus on academic labor markets in terms of “academic
    capitalism” and the restructuring of academic institutions, “managed
    professionals” and the restructuring of academic labor, and the efforts of
    “organizing professionals” to negotiate a new academy. Analytically, we
    focus on rising secondary labor markets. We also attend to their social
    demography, noting international and local dimensions that take us beyond
    and below the national labor markets that are the literature’s overriding
    focus. Finally, we map a new research agenda, for newly structured academic
    labor markets.

    Playing Against the House: The Dramatic World of an Undercover Union
    Organizer
  publisher: Simon and Schuster
  number-of-pages: '279'
  source: Google Books
  abstract: >-
    In the tradition of Barbara Ehrenreich’s classic Nickel and Dimed, a
    talented young journalist goes undercover as a casino labor-union organizer
    in this rare inside look at the ongoing struggle of hourly-wage service
    workers to survive in America.“Salting” is a simple concept—get hired at a
    non-union company, do the job you were hired to do, and, with the help of
    organizers on the outside, unionize your coworkers from the inside. James
    Walsh spent two years as a “salt” in two casinos in South Florida, working
    as a buffet server and a bartender. Neither his employers nor the union knew
    of Walsh’s intentions to write about his experience. Now he reveals hard-won
    and little-known truths about how unions fight to organize service workers,
    the vigorous corporate opposition against them, and how workers get caught
    in the middle. As a salt, Walsh witnessed the cultish nature of labor
    organization and was constantly grilled by his union organizer as to whether
    he had enough grit and determination to win converts to the cause while
    remaining undercover. At work, Walsh witnessed the oddities of casino life
    and management’s stunning mistreatment of service industry employees, most
    of whom were hanging on to economic survival by their fingernails. His
    meticulous reporting reveals supervisors berating workers for the smallest
    infractions, even as employees submit to relentless scrutiny, ever-changing
    work schedules, and the callous behavior of casino customers. A clear-eyed
    and balanced account, Playing Against the House explores the trials of
    day-to-day life for the working poor and the face of twenty-first-century
    union organizing and union busting in unprecedented detail.

    A new associate exits the office of Senior Partner with a research
    assignment. She returns to her office, sits down at the keyboard, pulls up
    her favorite search engine, and begins typing in keywords. This is the usual
    start to a research project by a novice researcher. This process may result
    in an answer; however, it is usually little more than an answer. The average
    attorney jumps into a research question without thinking.11 “The average
    attorney will dive into research without thinking. Don't yield to this
    temptation. Spend the time to just sit and think about your case, to know
    what question you should research.” Duane Ostler, The Strength Is in the
    Research, 20 Utah B.J. 42, 43 (2007). This article discusses the basic
    elements of a legal research plan, recommends designs of research plans, and
    identifies the role of the research log in the research process.

    Legal scholarship's main mode of formal communication, the law journal
    article, is mostly stuck in the print publishing model. By adopting some
    tools and practices made possible by digital communications, legal
    scholarship can become more accessible, flexible, and interdisciplinary.
    Instructive examples can be found in the science, technology, engineering,
    and medicine (STEM) journals. These practices are publishing in HTML and
    e-book formats and adopting persistent identifiers for scholarly works.

    Rich Texts: Wikisource as an Open Access Repository for Law and the
    Humanities
  genre: SSRN Scholarly Paper
  source: papers.ssrn.com
  abstract: >-
    Open access to research and scholarship, although well established in the
    sciences, remains an emerging phenomenon in the legal academy. In recent
    years, a number of open access repositories have been created to permit
    self-archiving of legal scholarship (either within or across institutional
    boundaries), and faculties at some leading research institutions have
    adopted policies supporting open access to their work. Although existing
    repositories for legal scholarship represent a clear improvement over
    proprietary, subscription-based repositories in some ways, their
    architecture, and the narrowly defined missions they have elected to pursue,
    limit their ability to illuminate the ongoing dialogue among texts that is a
    defining characteristic of scholarly discourse in law and the humanities.
    One of the wiki-based projects operated by the nonprofit Wikimedia
    Foundation - the Wikisource digital library - improves upon the shortcomings
    of existing open access repositories by bringing source texts and commentary
    together in a single place, with additional contextual materials hosted on
    other Wikimedia Foundation sites just a click away. These features of
    Wikisource, if more widely adopted, may improve academic discourse by
    highlighting conceptual interconnections among works, fostering
    interdisciplinary collaboration, and reducing the competitive advantages of
    proprietary, closed-access legal information services.

  abstract: >-
    In computational science, reproducibility requires that researchers make
    code and data available to others so that the data can be analyzed in a
    similar manner as in the original publication. Code must be available to be
    distributed, data must be accessible in a readable format, and a platform
    must be available for widely distributing the data and code. In addition,
    both data and code need to be licensed permissively enough so that others
    can reproduce the work without a substantial legal burden. Implementing
    Reproducible Research covers many of the elements necessary for conducting
    and distributing reproducible research. It explains how to accurately
    reproduce a scientific result.   Divided into three parts, the book
    discusses the tools, practices, and dissemination platforms for ensuring
    reproducibility in computational science. It describes:   Computational
    tools, such as Sweave, knitr, VisTrails, Sumatra, CDE, and the Declaratron
    system Open source practices, good programming practices, trends in open
    science, and the role of cloud computing in reproducible research Software
    and methodological platforms, including open source software packages,
    RunMyCode platform, and open access journals  Each part presents
    contributions from leaders who have developed software and other products
    that have advanced the field. Supplementary material is available at
    www.ImplementingRR.org.

    Compiling a referenced article for publication in a peer-reviewed journal is
    traditionally the most respected means of contributing to a body of
    knowledge. However, we argue that publication of evidence-based information
    via new media – especially blogging – can also be a valid form of academic
    scholarship. Blogs allow for rapid sharing of research methods, results, and
    conclusions in an open, transparent manner. With proper references, blogs
    and other new media can position academic research in the public sphere and
    provide rapid, reliable information in response to emerging issues. They can
    also support other traditional goals of higher education institutions,
    serving as tools for teaching, learning and outreach.

    A workflow for managing information for research using the iPad, Sente and

  abstract: >-
    This article describes how contemporary referencing software, a tablet
    device and speech-recognition software were used to improve the traditional
    research workflow, referring primarily to the process of finding journal
    articles, downloading the bibliographical details with full text, then
    reading and annotating them in an as efficient way as possible. This was
    done using Third Street's Sente referencing software on an Apple Mac to
    manage the bibliographical database and to automatically synchronise with
    its companion application on the iPad, then using the built-in tools of the
    Sente application on the iPad to highlight any text in the article that is
    of particular interest. The highlighted passages were automatically synced
    back to the Apple Mac application, and the researcher then used Nuance's
    Dragon Dictate on the Apple Mac to dictate a summary of the article directly
    into the notes field in Sente or into the notepad of Dragon Dictate.

    Digital journals have been widely adopted by academic researchers and have
    nearly replaced printed journals in many contexts. The adoption of digital
    books is accelerating. The transition to digital information has changed
    information workflows of researchers by transforming the methods they use to
    find, store, retrieve, and use information from monographs, journals, and
    other sources. It has also changed the needs and expectations of scholars in
    relation to research information. To investigate these changes, 45
    researchers in science, medicine, engineering, social sciences, and
    humanities at Stanford University were interviewed regarding information
    workflow and preferences. Results are compared with the findings of the
    e-Journal User Study (eJUSt), completed in 2002.

  volume: '49'

  abstract: >-
    As computational work becomes more and more integral to many aspects of
    scientific research, computational reproducibility has become an issue of
    increasing importance to computer systems researchers and domain scientists
    alike. Though computational reproducibility seems more straight forward than
    replicating physical experiments, the complex and rapidly changing nature of
    computer environments makes being able to reproduce and extend such work a
    serious challenge. In this paper, I explore common reasons that code
    developed for one research project cannot be successfully executed or
    extended by subsequent researchers. I review current approaches to these
    issues, including virtual machines and workflow systems, and their
    limitations. I then examine how the popular emerging technology Docker
    combines several areas from systems research - such as operating system
    virtualization, cross-platform portability, modular re-usable elements,
    versioning, and a 'DevOps' philosophy, to address these challenges. I
    illustrate this with several examples of Docker use with a focus on the R
    statistical environment.

    In this work we discuss the design and implementation of an academic cloud
    service christened Baadal. Tailored for academic and research requirements,
    Baadal bridges the gap between a private cloud and the requirements of an
    institution where request patterns and infrastructure are quite different
    from commercial settings. For example, researchers typically run simulations
    requiring hundreds of Virtual Machines (VMs) all communicating through
    message-passing interfaces to solve complex problems. We describe our
    experience with designing and developing a cloud workflow to support such
    requirements. Our workflow is quite different from that provided by other
    commercial cloud vendors (which we found not suited to our
    requirements).Another salient difference in academic computing
    infrastructure from commercial infrastructure is the physical resource
    availability. Often, a university has a small number of compute servers
    connected to shared SAN or NAS based storage. This may often not be enough
    to service the computation requirements of the whole university. Apart from
    this infrastructure, universities typically have a few hundred to a few
    thousand “workstations” which are commodity desktops with local
    disk-attached-storage. Most of these workstations remain grossly
    underutilized. Our cloud infrastructure utilizes this idle compute capacity
    to provide higher scalability for our cloud implementation.

    Since the turn of the twenty-first century, Canadian unions have scored a
    number of important Supreme Court victories, securing constitutional rights
    to picket, bargain collectively, and strike. Unions in Court documents the
    evolution of the Canadian labour movement's engagement with the Charter,
    demonstrating how and why labour's long-standing distrust of the legal
    system has given way to a controversial, Charter-based legal strategy. This
    book's in-depth examination of constitutional labour rights will have
    critical implications for labour movements as well as activists in other
    fields.

  source: Google Books
  abstract: >-
    Malcolm Feeley, one of the founding giants of the law and society field, is
    also one of its most exciting, diverse, and contemporary scholars. His works
    have examined criminal courts, prison reform, the legal profession, legal
    professionalism, and a variety of other important topics of enduring
    theoretical interest with a keen eye for the practical implications. In this
    volume, The Legal Process and the Promise of Justice, an eminent group of
    contemporary law and society scholars offer fresh and original analyzes of
    his work. They asses the legacy of Feeley's theoretical innovations, put his
    findings to the test of time, and provide provocative historical and
    international perspectives for his insights. This collection of original
    essays not only draws attention to Professor Feeley's seminal writings but
    also to the theories and ideas of others who, inspired by Feeley, have
    explored how courts and the legal process really work to provide a promise
    of justice.
