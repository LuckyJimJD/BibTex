Unions in Court documents the evolution of the Canadian labour movement's engagement with the Charter, demonstrating how and why labour's long-standing distrust of the legal system has given way to a controversial, Charter-based legal strategy. This book's in-depth examination of constitutional labour rights will have critical implications for labour movements as well as activists in other fields.},
