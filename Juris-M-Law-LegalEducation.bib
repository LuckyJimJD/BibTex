  abstract = {Clinical legal education is playing an increasingly important role in educating lawyers worldwide. In The Global Clinical Movement: Educating Lawyers for Social Justice, editor Frank S. Bloch and contributors describe the central concepts, goals, and methods of clinical legal education from a global perspective, with a particular emphasis on its social justice mission. With chapters written by leading clinical legal educators from every region of the world, The Global Clinical Movement demonstrates how the emerging global clinical movement can advance social justice through legal education. Professor Bloch and the contributors also examine the influence of clinical legal education on the legal academy and the legal profession and chart the global clinical movement's future role in educating lawyers for social justice. The Global Clinical Movement consists of three parts. Part I describes clinical legal education programs from every region of the world and discusses those qualities that are unique to a particular country or region. Part II discusses the various ways that clinical programs and the clinical methodology advance the cause of social justice around the world. Part III analyzes the current state of the global clinical movement and sets out an agenda for the movement to advance social justice through socially relevant legal education.},

Students can develop these components of the legal profession during law school to excel in the practice of law. Legal educators can contribute to the development of Professional Identity without overhauling the curriculum via short additional assignments or by tweaking existing assignments. This article will review the history of professional identity, the recommendations of The Carnegie Report, and identify the three methods I use to encourage the development of professional identity in the writing and research classroom.},

As a Legal Teaching “profession” it is incumbent on us to answer this call in a responsive, creative, integrated, well researched and evaluated manner. This paper provides a suggested and evaluated framework for how this call can be met without resorting to “add on” subjects (no matter how well-intentioned), that stand outside the “normal” law school curriculum. Instead of partitioning well-being and professionalism into separate silos, it is suggested that all efforts must be made to integrate the seeds, thoughts, and actions of ethics, well-being, and professionalism into as many aspects of each of our programs as possible.},

It is becoming increasingly clear that simulations can be used for educational purposes, but how can they be used most effectively with students? How do they affect other areas of the legal curriculum? Can all professions use them equally effectively, and if so under which conditions? These and other questions are at centre of a two-year funded project, Transactional Learning Environment (TLE) 2.0, which sets out to create an environment, use it within variety of disciplines and sub-areas within law, and evaluate the results. This article describes the context of the project, sets out the ambitions of the project, and analyses the challenges facing it. It also sets the project within a larger technological context, and argues that such projects are essential not only for the future of legal education but for most professional disciplines in higher education.},

Demonstrating how simulation can be constructed and developed for learning, teaching and assessment, the text argues that simulation is a pedagogically valuable and practical tool in teaching the modern law curriculum. With contributions from law teachers within the UK, Australia, Hong Kong, South Africa and the USA, the authors draw on their experiences in teaching law in the areas of clinical legal education, legal process, evidence, criminal law, family law and employment law as well as teaching law to non-law students. They claim that simulation, as a form of experiential and problem-based learning, enables students to integrate the ’classroom’ experience with the real world experiences they will encounter in their professional lives. This book will be of relevance not only to law teachers but university teachers generally, as well as those interested in legal education and the theory of law.},

  abstract = {After the 2008 global financial crisis, US law schools suffered a steep drop in enrollment. In response, many professional law programs, especially so-called fourth-tier institutions, turned to ethnoracial minorities as a new market for student recruitment. They relaxed admissions standards, enabling more “diverse” students to finance their studies with guaranteed federal student loans. By raising diversity in a lower-status “southern hemisphere” of legal education and services, however, this new approach replaced outright exclusion with a racialized professional dualism justified by the neoliberal ideology of market access. Some have called this an “apartheid model”—a freighted term with broad theoretical and ethical entanglements. This pairing of race and free-market logics resembles wider, specious extensions of market citizenship into the global peripheries.
