  abstract = {Open access to research and scholarship, although well established in the sciences, remains an emerging phenomenon in the legal academy. In recent years, a number of open access repositories have been created to permit self-archiving of legal scholarship (either within or across institutional boundaries), and faculties at some leading research institutions have adopted policies supporting open access to their work. Although existing repositories for legal scholarship represent a clear improvement over proprietary, subscription-based repositories in some ways, their architecture, and the narrowly defined missions they have elected to pursue, limit their ability to illuminate the ongoing dialogue among texts that is a defining characteristic of scholarly discourse in law and the humanities. One of the wiki-based projects operated by the nonprofit Wikimedia Foundation - the Wikisource digital library - improves upon the shortcomings of existing open access repositories by bringing source texts and commentary together in a single place, with additional contextual materials hosted on other Wikimedia Foundation sites just a click away. These features of Wikisource, if more widely adopted, may improve academic discourse by highlighting conceptual interconnections among works, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, and reducing the competitive advantages of proprietary, closed-access legal information services.},

  abstract = {As computational work becomes more and more integral to many aspects of scientific research, computational reproducibility has become an issue of increasing importance to computer systems researchers and domain scientists alike. Though computational reproducibility seems more straight forward than replicating physical experiments, the complex and rapidly changing nature of computer environments makes being able to reproduce and extend such work a serious challenge. In this paper, I explore common reasons that code developed for one research project cannot be successfully executed or extended by subsequent researchers. I review current approaches to these issues, including virtual machines and workflow systems, and their limitations. I then examine how the popular emerging technology Docker combines several areas from systems research - such as operating system virtualization, cross-platform portability, modular re-usable elements, versioning, and a 'DevOps' philosophy, to address these challenges. I illustrate this with several examples of Docker use with a focus on the R statistical environment.},

  abstract = {In this work we discuss the design and implementation of an academic cloud service christened Baadal. Tailored for academic and research requirements, Baadal bridges the gap between a private cloud and the requirements of an institution where request patterns and infrastructure are quite different from commercial settings. For example, researchers typically run simulations requiring hundreds of Virtual Machines (VMs) all communicating through message-passing interfaces to solve complex problems. We describe our experience with designing and developing a cloud workflow to support such requirements. Our workflow is quite different from that provided by other commercial cloud vendors (which we found not suited to our requirements).Another salient difference in academic computing infrastructure from commercial infrastructure is the physical resource availability. Often, a university has a small number of compute servers connected to shared SAN or NAS based storage. This may often not be enough to service the computation requirements of the whole university. Apart from this infrastructure, universities typically have a few hundred to a few thousand “workstations” which are commodity desktops with local disk-attached-storage. Most of these workstations remain grossly underutilized. Our cloud infrastructure utilizes this idle compute capacity to provide higher scalability for our cloud implementation.},

This process may result in an answer; however, it is usually little more than an answer. The average attorney jumps into a research question without thinking.11 “The average attorney will dive into research without thinking. Don't yield to this temptation. Spend the time to just sit and think about your case, to know what question you should research.” Duane Ostler, The Strength Is in the Research, 20 Utah B.J. 42, 43 (2007). This article discusses the basic elements of a legal research plan, recommends designs of research plans, and identifies the role of the research log in the research process.},

  abstract = {Compiling a referenced article for publication in a peer-reviewed journal is traditionally the most respected means of contributing to a body of knowledge. However, we argue that publication of evidence-based information via new media – especially blogging – can also be a valid form of academic scholarship. Blogs allow for rapid sharing of research methods, results, and conclusions in an open, transparent manner. With proper references, blogs and other new media can position academic research in the public sphere and provide rapid, reliable information in response to emerging issues. They can also support other traditional goals of higher education institutions, serving as tools for teaching, learning and outreach.},

  abstract = {In computational science, reproducibility requires that researchers make code and data available to others so that the data can be analyzed in a similar manner as in the original publication. Code must be available to be distributed, data must be accessible in a readable format, and a platform must be available for widely distributing the data and code. In addition, both data and code need to be licensed permissively enough so that others can reproduce the work without a substantial legal burden. Implementing Reproducible Research covers many of the elements necessary for conducting and distributing reproducible research. It explains how to accurately reproduce a scientific result.   Divided into three parts, the book discusses the tools, practices, and dissemination platforms for ensuring reproducibility in computational science. It describes:   Computational tools, such as Sweave, knitr, VisTrails, Sumatra, CDE, and the Declaratron system Open source practices, good programming practices, trends in open science, and the role of cloud computing in reproducible research Software and methodological platforms, including open source software packages, RunMyCode platform, and open access journals  Each part presents contributions from leaders who have developed software and other products that have advanced the field.
