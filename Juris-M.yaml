    Bad Jobs in America: Standard and Nonstandard Employment Relations and Job
    Quality in the United States
  container-title: American Sociological Review
  page: 256-278
  volume: '65'
  issue: '2'
  source: JSTOR
  abstract: >-
    The prevalence of nonstandard jobs is a matter of concern if, as many
    assume, such jobs are bad. We examine the relationship between nonstandard
    employment (on-call work and day labor, temporary-help agency employment,
    employment with contract companies, independent contracting, other
    self-employment, and part-time employment in "conventional" jobs) and
    exposure to "bad" job characteristics, using data from the 1995 Current
    Population Survey. Of workers age 18 and over, 31 percent are in some type
    of nonstandard employment. To assess the link between type of employment and
    bad jobs, we conceptualize "bad jobs" as those with low pay and without
    access to health insurance and pension benefits. About one in seven jobs in
    the United States is bad on these three dimensions. Nonstandard employment
    strongly increases workers' exposure to bad job characteristics, net of
    controls for workers' personal characteristics, family status, occupation,
    and industry.

    Reorganizing Higher Education in the United States and Canada: The Erosion
    of Tenure and the Unionization of Contingent Faculty
  container-title: Labor Studies Journal
  page: 117-140
  volume: '33'
  issue: '2'
  source: SAGE Journals
  abstract: >-
    Every year in Canada and the U.S., the share of higher education faculty who
    teach off the tenure track grows. One might expect that faculty unionization
    would limit this process, but the data examined here indicate that this is
    not so. While Canadian universities are significantly more unionized than
    their U.S. counterparts, they rely at least as heavily on contingent
    faculty. Similarly, U.S. states with high levels of unionization do not
    exhibit lower levels of casualization. Union strategies that
    institutionalize divisions between tenure-track and non-tenure-track, and/or
    between part-time and full-time faculty, probably play a role in this
    outcome. They can and should also play a pivotal role in reversing these
    trends if they develop the political will to do so.

  abstract: >-
    It has been over two decades since the United States Supreme Court handed
    down the landmark Yeshiva decision. In that case, the faculty in a private
    university was determined to be "managerial" and not entitled to collective
    bargaining rights and other protections under federal labor law. Despite
    Yeshiva's broad and significant impact in deterring faculty organizing at
    private colleges and universities, successful union organizing drives,
    though few, have been growing more frequent on campuses across the United
    States. In this paper, we examine the Yeshiva case and analyze its
    implications for private and public universities, including current trends
    such as the increased use of contingent faculty and distance learning. We
    also examine successful organizing efforts and discuss their implications
    for organized labor.

  source: SAGE Journals
  abstract: >-
    The author's goal in this article is to estimate the causal effect of
    unionization on institutional decision-making, using a national survey of
    presidents and faculty senate leaders to measure the level of shared
    governance at 341 public universities in 15 different areas. To handle the
    endogeneity of faculty unionization, an index of state employee collective
    bargaining rights is used as an instrument for unionization. Findings
    indicate that unionization greatly increases faculty influence over
    institutional decision-making, both in compensation and in areas outside of
    compensation.

  abstract: >-
    This study traces the development of union loyalties among community college
    professors. Assuming that activism is motivated by contextual and
    ideological factors, the paper analyzes the ways that social networks,
    collegiate workplaces, and framing practices transform political bystanders
    into committed union members. Using data from a study of junior college
    professors in Kentucky (N = 329), the study finds that union participation
    is strongly linked to a distrust of campus administrators and having
    pro-union friends and colleagues. Likewise, perceptions of union efficacy, a
    liberal identity as well the professor’s education level predicted the
    actual joining of their campus’ faculty union.

  source: Wiley Online Library
  abstract: >-
    Feminist philosophers have challenged a wide range of gender injustices in
    professional philosophy. However, the problem of precarity, that is, the
    increasing numbers of contingent faculty who cannot find permanent
    employment, has received scarcely any attention. What explains this
    oversight? In this article, I argue, first, that academics are held in the
    grips of an ideology that diverts attention away from the structural
    conditions of precarity, and second, that the gendered dimensions of such an
    ideology have been overlooked. To do so, I identify two myths: the myth of
    meritocracy and the myth of work as its own reward. I demonstrate that these
    myths—and the two-tier system itself—manifest an unmistakably gendered
    logic, such that gender and precarity are mutually reinforcing and
    co-constitutive. I conclude that feminist philosophers have particular
    reason to organize against the casualization of academic work.

    This article begins with a brief history of unionization and collective
    bargaining in higher education.  It then presents data concerning the recent
    growth in newly certified collective bargaining representatives at private
    and public-sector institutions of higher education, particularly among
    non-tenure track faculty.  The data is analyzed in the context of legal
    decisions concerning employee status and unit composition under applicable
    federal and state laws.  Lastly, the article presents data concerning strike
    activities on campuses between January 2013 and May 31, 2017.

    Organizing as Learning: The Metro Strategy and a Community of Practice for
    Faculty
  container-title: WorkingUSA
  page: 421-433
  volume: '18'
  issue: '3'
  source: Wiley Online Library
  abstract: >-
    Organizing of adjunct faculty is intensifying, and now is a good time to
    talk about strategies. This article argues that while the “hot shop”
    strategy, with its emphasis on getting authorization cards signed and moving
    swiftly toward an election, is racking up wins, it risks failing to develop
    the respectful interpersonal relationships that can carry a union through
    the hard times of bargaining and enforcing a contract. Two other strategies
    can make a difference. They depend on providing an answer to the question
    “Who is we?”, which is a counter to the fragmentation of the faculty
    workforce created by budgets, labor law, administrative fiat, and management
    tools intended to undermine solidarity. One is the Metro Strategy, which
    treats a whole regional faculty workforce as a single “we,” recognizing the
    realities of commute times, parking problems, and conflicting schedules. It
    recommends setting up a centrally located workers' center that provides both
    material resources like WiFi, meeting rooms, and toilets, and organizing
    resources like information. It acknowledges a regional, not
    institution-bound, workforce. The second strategy addresses the disciplinary
    achievements of adjunct faculty, who are often invisible within our own
    institutions. This strategy is drawn from theories of communities of
    practice generated by the anthropologist, Jean Lave, who investigated how
    communities as diverse as tailors and midwives passed on the wisdom and
    skills of their practices from one generation to another. Organizing using
    this approach as a guide means focusing on what the adjuncts who share a
    discipline or practice actually do in their professional, academic lives.
    This allows space for a “we” based on our real work, not on what an
    institution defines us to be.

    Academic Capitalism and (Secondary) Academic Labor Markets: Negotiating a
    New Academy and Research Agenda

  abstract: >-
    The chapter examines how academic labor markets in the U.S. are socially
    structured. These markets express and enhance social stratification, and are
    reproduced and renegotiated through ongoing social action. First, we review
    the classic literature on the subject. Then we consider the presence of
    secondary labor markets in STEM fields, contextualizing our consideration of
    academic labor markets in developments in the larger labor force.
    Subsequently, we focus on academic labor markets in terms of “academic
    capitalism” and the restructuring of academic institutions, “managed
    professionals” and the restructuring of academic labor, and the efforts of
    “organizing professionals” to negotiate a new academy. Analytically, we
    focus on rising secondary labor markets. We also attend to their social
    demography, noting international and local dimensions that take us beyond
    and below the national labor markets that are the literature’s overriding
    focus. Finally, we map a new research agenda, for newly structured academic
    labor markets.

    Playing Against the House: The Dramatic World of an Undercover Union
    Organizer
  publisher: Simon and Schuster
  number-of-pages: '279'
  source: Google Books
  abstract: >-
    In the tradition of Barbara Ehrenreich’s classic Nickel and Dimed, a
    talented young journalist goes undercover as a casino labor-union organizer
    in this rare inside look at the ongoing struggle of hourly-wage service
    workers to survive in America.“Salting” is a simple concept—get hired at a
    non-union company, do the job you were hired to do, and, with the help of
    organizers on the outside, unionize your coworkers from the inside. James
    Walsh spent two years as a “salt” in two casinos in South Florida, working
    as a buffet server and a bartender. Neither his employers nor the union knew
    of Walsh’s intentions to write about his experience. Now he reveals hard-won
    and little-known truths about how unions fight to organize service workers,
    the vigorous corporate opposition against them, and how workers get caught
    in the middle. As a salt, Walsh witnessed the cultish nature of labor
    organization and was constantly grilled by his union organizer as to whether
    he had enough grit and determination to win converts to the cause while
    remaining undercover. At work, Walsh witnessed the oddities of casino life
    and management’s stunning mistreatment of service industry employees, most
    of whom were hanging on to economic survival by their fingernails. His
    meticulous reporting reveals supervisors berating workers for the smallest
    infractions, even as employees submit to relentless scrutiny, ever-changing
    work schedules, and the callous behavior of casino customers. A clear-eyed
    and balanced account, Playing Against the House explores the trials of
    day-to-day life for the working poor and the face of twenty-first-century
    union organizing and union busting in unprecedented detail.
