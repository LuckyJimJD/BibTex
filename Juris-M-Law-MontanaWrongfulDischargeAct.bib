Shareholder returns were significantly higher given the Act than they would have been absent the law. This reflects shareholders' estimate of the effects of the Act on the future profitability of their firms. The increase in profitability would have been due to the benefits the Act gave to employers in Montana.},

  abstract = {Across the US each year, thousands of employees sue their employers for wrongful discharge, and the stakes can be quit high. In Flanigan vs. Prudential Savings Court, the Montana Supreme Court upheld a jury award of almost \$1.5 million to a bank teller discharged without good cause following 28 years of good service. The relevant aspects of current law are outlined and a practical guide for Montana business owners and managers hoping to avoid such costly wrongful discharge lawsuits is presented. The Wrongful Discharge From Employment Act (WDFEA) became effective July 1, 1987. The WDFEA restored much of the previous latitude employers had in the termination process, while also reflecting recent judicial concern for grossly unfair treatment of employees. Important features of the WDFEA include: 1. It eliminates punitive damages except where actual fraud and malice can be proved. 2. It establishes a one-year statute of limitations for filing a wrongful discharge action.},

We find robust evidence that one wrongful-discharge doctrine, the implied-contract exception, reduced state employment rates by 0.8\% to 1.7\%. The initial impact is largest for female and less-educated workers (those who change jobs frequently), while the longer-term effect is greater for older and more-educated workers (those most likely to litigate). By contrast, we find no robust employment or wage effects of two other widely recognized wrongful-discharge laws: the public-policy and goodfaith exceptions.},

The results are surprising and quite striking. Precedents by other courts within the same federal circuit region were generally more influential in the diffusion process than precedents by courts in neighboring states or by courts within the same census or West legal reporting region, even though the precedents were on matters of state law rather than federal law and the decisions were usually made by state courts rather than federal courts. There is some limited evidence that political variables may also have been a factor, but economic variables were not statistically significant, even though the new employment laws may have had important economic consequences.

A new kind of restricted worker born from nineteenth‐century free labor politics, employer and citizen worker demands under modern liberal capitalism, and state labor market regulation, temporary migrants have always had an employer‐dependent legal status and been subject to deportation. Yet, since 1942, changing rights and legal processes have governed migrant employment termination across sectors. By drawing on employment cases from archival and unpublished files made available to me under FOIA, and court decisions, I compare the impact of laws of employment termination on deportable laborers beginning in 1942, when government agencies planned migration, and under privatized migration after 1964. From agriculture and war to today's service and knowledge economies, I demonstrate how employment rights have always shaped deportable workers' legal status. Yet, I also show how today's rights and legal processes, in contrast to the past, hardly mitigate employer control over migrants under contemporary capitalism.},

The new statute was a legislative response to a series of Montana Supreme Court cases, starting in 1980, that gave otherwise at-will employees a broad right to sue for wrongful discharge. Estimating a policy intervention model using monthly time-series data on Montana employment, the authors find that the seminal Montana wrongful discharge case reduced annual employment growth in Montana by 0.46 percentage points, and that the “good cause” statute restored the original growth rate. While the firing costs literature would suggest that employment should fall following implementation of a heightened discharge standard, the contrary result in Montana is likely due to important procedural and other limitations imposed by the new statute on discharged employees' legal recourse.},

  abstract = {The United States is distinctive among advanced economies in that its employment laws and practices are governed by Employment at Will (EAW). Most other nations have variations on Just Cause dismissal rules. I argue that the U.S. preference for EAW is unsupported by concerns about net social or economic consequences. More centrally, I argue that the basic moral commitments that underlie the U.S. system of private property and freedom of contract are commitments that lend support to Just Cause over EAW.},

  abstract = {The uncertainties of common law wrongful dismissal laws have resulted in proposals for comprehensive legislation codifying "just cause" and other protections for employees, culminating in the approval by the commis­ sioners on uniform state laws of a model wrongful termination from employ­ ment act. The resulting model act represents a balanced approach to rationalizing a mess. This article briefly reviews the interests involved and sketches a resulting political calculus. It identifies the basic conceptual alter­ natives for wrongful dismissal legislation and then summarizes the principal features of the new model act. The article concludes that potential constitu­ tional challenges against wrongful dismissal legislation like the model act lack merit.},
