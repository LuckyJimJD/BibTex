    Playing Against the House: The Dramatic World of an Undercover Union
    Organizer
  publisher: Simon and Schuster
  number-of-pages: '279'
  source: Google Books
  abstract: >-
    In the tradition of Barbara Ehrenreich’s classic Nickel and Dimed, a
    talented young journalist goes undercover as a casino labor-union organizer
    in this rare inside look at the ongoing struggle of hourly-wage service
    workers to survive in America.“Salting” is a simple concept—get hired at a
    non-union company, do the job you were hired to do, and, with the help of
    organizers on the outside, unionize your coworkers from the inside. James
    Walsh spent two years as a “salt” in two casinos in South Florida, working
    as a buffet server and a bartender. Neither his employers nor the union knew
    of Walsh’s intentions to write about his experience. Now he reveals hard-won
    and little-known truths about how unions fight to organize service workers,
    the vigorous corporate opposition against them, and how workers get caught
    in the middle. As a salt, Walsh witnessed the cultish nature of labor
    organization and was constantly grilled by his union organizer as to whether
    he had enough grit and determination to win converts to the cause while
    remaining undercover. At work, Walsh witnessed the oddities of casino life
    and management’s stunning mistreatment of service industry employees, most
    of whom were hanging on to economic survival by their fingernails. His
    meticulous reporting reveals supervisors berating workers for the smallest
    infractions, even as employees submit to relentless scrutiny, ever-changing
    work schedules, and the callous behavior of casino customers. A clear-eyed
    and balanced account, Playing Against the House explores the trials of
    day-to-day life for the working poor and the face of twenty-first-century
    union organizing and union busting in unprecedented detail.
