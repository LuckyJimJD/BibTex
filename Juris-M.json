While Zionism achieved its primary aim—the founding of a Jewish state—the Jewish Labor Bund has not only practically disappeared, but its ideals of socialism and secular Jewishness based in the diaspora seem to have failed. Yet, as Zvi Gitelman and the various contributors argue, it was the Bund that more profoundly changed the structure of Jewish society, politics, and culture.     In thirteen essays, prominent historians, political scientists, and professors of literature discuss the cultural and political contexts of these movements, their impact on Jewish life, and the reasons for the Bund’s demise, and they question whether ethnic minorities are best served by highly ideological or  solidly pragmatic movements.","ISBN":"978-0-8229-4188-0","language":"English","editor":[{"family":"Gitelman","given":"Zvi"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2003,3,2]]},"publisher-place":"Pittsbugh, Pa","title-short":"The Emergence Of Modern Jewish Politics"},

In this brilliant and immensely readable book, Lawrence M. Friedman tells the whole fascinating story of American law from its beginnings in the colonies to the present day.

  {"id":"kelmanGuideCriticalLegal1990","type":"book","title":"A Guide to Critical Legal Studies","publisher":"Harvard University Press","number-of-pages":"367","abstract":"Until now there has been no summary or overview of the wide range of work contributing to critical legal studies, the movement that has aroused such a furor in the communities of law and political philosophy. This book outlines and evaluates the principal strands of critical legal studies, and achieves much more as well. A good deal of the writing in critical legal studies has been devoted to laying bare the contradictions in liberal thought. There have been attacks and counterattacks on the liberal position and on the more conservative law and economics position. Now Mark Kelman demonstrates that any critique of law and economics is inextricably tied to a broader critique of liberalism. There are three central contradictions in liberal thought: between a commitment to mechanically applicable rules and to standards that ﬂuctuate with situations; between intrinsic individual values and the objective knowledge of ethical truths; and between free will and determinism. Kelman shows us the pervasiveness of these contradictions in legal doctrine; their connection to broader political theory and to visions of human nature; and, ﬁnally, the degree to which mainstream thought tends to privilege certain of these commitments over others. The author also analyzes two of the most signiﬁcant components of jurisprudence today the law and economics discipline and the legal process school. He concludes with a lively discussion of the role of law generally and of \"cognitive legitimation,\" or the ways in which legal thought can make the unnecessary, the contingent, and the unjust seem natural, inevitable, and fair.","ISBN":"0-674-36756-1","call-number":"0317","note":"00415","author":[{"family":"Kelman","given":"Mark"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[1990]]}},

Yosef Gorny traces the concept of the Jewish nation from the foundation of the Bund and the first Zionist Congress in 1897 until the remains of the Bund decided to join the Jewish local and world institutions in 1985. The following events from those years are covered: the Soviet Revolution, the Balfour declaration, the founding of the Polish Republic, the British Mandate on Palestine, the rise of the Nazi party in Germany, the Jewish-Arab conflict, the Holocaust, and the gradual disappearance of the two movements from the historical stage. This innovative approach to the Bund and Zionist movements helps explain the connection between nationalism and multiculturalism in the Jewish modern tradition.","ISBN":"978-0-7914-6659-9","language":"English","author":[{"family":"Gorny","given":"Professor Yosef"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2006,1,19]]},"publisher-place":"New York","title-short":"Converging Alternatives"},

We examine the relationship between nonstandard employment (on-call work and day labor, temporary-help agency employment, employment with contract companies, independent contracting, other self-employment, and part-time employment in \"conventional\" jobs) and exposure to \"bad\" job characteristics, using data from the 1995 Current Population Survey. Of workers age 18 and over, 31 percent are in some type of nonstandard employment. To assess the link between type of employment and bad jobs, we conceptualize \"bad jobs\" as those with low pay and without access to health insurance and pension benefits. About one in seven jobs in the United States is bad on these three dimensions. Nonstandard employment strongly increases workers' exposure to bad job characteristics, net of controls for workers' personal characteristics, family status, occupation, and industry.","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/2657440","DOI":"10.2307/2657440","ISSN":"0003-1224","author":[{"family":"Kalleberg","given":"Arne L."},{"family":"Reskin","given":"Barbara F."},{"family":"Hudson","given":"Ken"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2000]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,12,20]]},"title-short":"Bad Jobs in America","container-title-short":"American Sociological Review"},

Though 100 years have passed since its inception, the Bund and its legacy continue to be of abiding interest. Founded illegally and operated under the most adverse conditions, the Bund grew dramatically in the years immediately after its 1897 creation in Czarist Russia. It helped to organize the Russian Social Democratic Workers Party, it organized armed self-defense groups to fight against pogroms, and it played a significant role in the Russian Revolution of 1905. The Bundist became for many the symbol of the new Jew--enlightened, willing to fight for Jewish rights and needs, and unwilling to accept the status quo of Jewish communities dominated by the orthodox and the wealthy, and of a Russia oppressed by the Czar. Later, Bundist members were among those who contributed substantially to armed resistance in Nazi occupied Poland. Jewish Politics in Eastern Europe makes use of previously unexamined source materials to offer a range of new perspectives on the significance of the Bund and its ideas. Its fresh and insightful approaches will be of interest to all those concerned with Eastern European Jewry, Russian, Polish, and Ukranian history, and the history of socialist and labor movements.","ISBN":"978-0-8147-4258-7","language":"English","editor":[{"family":"Jacobs","given":"Jack"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2001,7]]},"publisher-place":"New York","title-short":"Jewish Politics in Eastern Europe"},

The Jewish Workers’ Bund, which had a socialist,secularist, Yiddishist, and anti-Zionist orientation, won a series ofimportant electoral battles in Poland on the eve of the SecondWorld War and became a major political party. While many earlierworks on the politics of Polish Jewry have suggested that Bundistvictories were not of lasting significance or attributable to outsideforces, Jack Jacobs argues convincingly that the electoral successof the Bund was linked to the work of the constellation of culturaland other organizations revolving around the party.The Bund offered its constituents innovative, highly attractive,programs and a more enlightened perspective: from new sexualmores to sporting organizations and educational institutions.Drawing on meticulously researched archival materials, Jacobsshows how the growth of these successful programs translated intoa stronger, more robust party. At the same time, he suggests theBund’s limitations, highlighting its failed women’s movement.Jacobs provides a fascinating account of this countercultural movementand a thoughtful revision to the accepted view.","ISBN":"978-0-8156-3226-9","language":"English","author":[{"family":"Jacobs","given":"Jack"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,5,1]]},"publisher-place":"Syracuse, N.Y"},

But the decades after the Second World War were years of enormous difficulty for Bundists. Like millions of other European Jews, they faced the challenge of resurrecting their lives, so gravely disrupted by the Holocaust. Not only had the organization lost many members, but its adherents were also scattered across many continents. In this book, David Slucki charts the efforts of the surviving remnants of the movement to salvage something from the wreckage.Covering both the Bundists who remained in communist Eastern Europe and those who emigrated to the United States, France, Australia, and Israel, the book explores the common challenges they faced—building transnational networks of friends, family, and fellow Holocaust survivors, while rebuilding a once-local movement under a global umbrella. This is a story of resilience and passion—passion for an idea that only barely survived Auschwitz.","ISBN":"978-0-8135-5168-5","language":"English","author":[{"family":"Slucki","given":"Dr David"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,1,17]]},"publisher-place":"New Brunswick, N.J","title-short":"The International Jewish Labor Bund after 1945"},

It traces the origins of two influential but overlooked strains of Jewish thought―Yiddishism and Diaspora Nationalism―and documents the waning hopes and painful reassessments of their leading representatives against the rising tide of Nazism and, later, the Holocaust.Joshua M. Karlip presents three figures―Elias Tcherikower, Yisroel Efroikin, and Zelig Kalmanovitch―seen through the lens of Imperial Russia on the brink of revolution. Leaders in the struggle for recognition of the Jewish people as a national entity, these men would prove instrumental in formulating the politics of Diaspora Nationalism, a middle path that rejected both the Zionist emphasis on Palestine and the Marxist faith in class struggle. Closely allied with this ideology was Yiddishism, a movement whose adherents envisioned the Yiddish language and culture, not religious tradition, as the unifying force of Jewish identity.We follow Tcherikower, Efroikin, and Kalmanovitch as they navigate the tumultuous early decades of the twentieth century in pursuit of a Jewish national renaissance in Eastern Europe. Correcting the misconception of Yiddishism as a radically secular movement, Karlip uncovers surprising confluences between Judaism and the avowedly nonreligious forms of Jewish nationalism. An essential contribution to Jewish historiography, The Tragedy of a Generation is a probing and poignant chronicle of lives shaped by ideological conviction and tested to the limits by historical crisis.","ISBN":"978-0-674-07285-5","language":"English","author":[{"family":"Karlip","given":"Joshua M."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,7,15]]},"publisher-place":"Cambridge, Massachusetts","title-short":"The Tragedy of a Generation"},
